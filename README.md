# SI 507: Final Project
# Yelp Restaurant Recommendation Tool

## Description
This tool offers targeted and personalized restaurant recommendations based on the usersâ€™ keywords and preferences. For example, when a user searches for a "Japanese restaurant in Los Angeles," the tool begins searching and provides various options, including online reviews, restaurant ratings, and cuisine recommendations to help users make informed decisions.

## Interaction and Presentation
### User Interaction
  - **Cuisine Preference**: Users can type in their preferred cuisine type (e.g., "new american", "Japanese").
  - **Price Range Preference**: Users are asked to specify their budget using predefined price ranges (e.g., "$10-$20", "$20-$30"). The tool maps these ranges to Yelp's price format.
  - **Location Preference**: Users input their desired location for restaurant recommendations (e.g., "west hollywood", "Los Angeles").
- **Processing User Input**:
  - Once preferences are entered, the tool processes these inputs to filter and retrieve relevant restaurant data from Yelp.
  - The filtered results are then presented in the command line, displaying a list of restaurants that match the user's criteria.
- **Output Information**:
  - For each recommended restaurant, the tool displays key information such as the restaurant's name, its Yelp rating, price level, and a link to the Yelp page.
  - This information assists users in making an informed choice about where to dine.

### Running the Program
